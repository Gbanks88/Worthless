# Cross-Platform Operating System Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a cross-platform operating system compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows architectures.

## Core Components

1. Kernel Layer
   - Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
   - Memory management
   - Process scheduling
   - File system interface
   - Device drivers

2. System Interface
   - POSIX compliance
   - System calls
   - IPC mechanisms
   - Threading model

3. Platform-Specific Modules
   - Mac compatibility layer
   - Linux compatibility layer
   - Windows compatibility layer

## Build Requirements
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- GCC/Clang cross-compiler
- Make build system
- QEMU for testing

## Development Roadmap

1. Phase 1: Core Boot and Kernel
   - Bootloader implementation
   - Basic kernel initialization
   - Memory management setup

2. Phase 2: Hardware Abstraction
   - Device driver framework
   - Basic device support
   - Hardware detection

3. Phase 3: System Interface
   - POSIX implementation
   - System call interface
   - Basic file system

4. Phase 4: Platform Compatibility
   - Platform-specific HAL
   - ABI compatibility
   - System call translation

## Building and Testing

Instructions for building and testing will be added as the project progresses.
